# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report it privately to the project maintainers by selecting "Report a vulnerability" under the project's "Issues" tab, or by contacting a project member directly.

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible).
- Potential impact (what an attacker could do).
- Any suggested fix (if you have one).

## Coordinated Disclosure

We aim to respond to valid reports as quickly as possible and work toward a fix before any public disclosure.

Please avoid publicly sharing the vulnerability details until a patch is released, or we confirm it is safe to disclose.

## Fix Timeline

We will make a best effort to patch confirmed vulnerabilities within 90 days, depending on severity and team availability.

## Bounties

This project is maintained as part of a student/team effort and is not backed by funding.

Because of this, we are unable to offer bug bounties at this time - but we deeply appreciate responsible disclosure and contributions.

## Third-Party Dependencies

If the vulnerability is found in a third-party dependency (Expo, React Native, npm packages, etc.), please report it to the maintainers of that dependency as well.
